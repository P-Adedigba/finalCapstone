1.	Description of project:
  Lists, dictionaries, functions, string and files were all used in the program. Adequate steps was also taken to deal with user errors as well as security in the code. The users are also able to add and assign tasks to users and monitor progress. Six different 
  functions were created
  Depending on what the user wants to achieve, one of the functions would be called. In other words, each function perform specific unit of work. This is an indication that the principle of abstraction was adopted as all the tasks are hidden in the functions. 
  Users are also able to change the deadlines. User with admin rights can generate various reports such as display all the tasks and users. They can also change aspects of the tasks or reassign tasks. Every users can also log in to view their own tasks.
 
2.	Getting Started and Installation 
   The code should by ran on an IDEs such as PyCharm or VS Code. The path that will store the files or where the files are stored already needs to be added to the terminal as path. If no such file, the code will create the files in the path folder. Alternativetely, the 
   folder containing the code and all the relevant files can be opened as a folder on VS Code or PyCharm.

3.	Usage and outputs
   This is a python code that allows a small business to create and add new users to a text file user.txt. It was designed to help a business manage tasks assigned to each member of a team.
  	
   3.1 No two users can have the same username as can be see below. When a user with the name Bob was to be added, it was not possible as the username was already taken.
